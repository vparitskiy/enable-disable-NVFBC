# enable-disable-NVFBC-
Scripts (*.bat) files to quickly enable/disable NVFBC hardware encoder on HOST PC for compatible Nvidia cards.
When NVFBC is disabled, Steam uses NVIFR. Try it if you want, works for me on Windows 7 64bit. So I no more need to uninstall/reinstall GeForce Experience to do this. Don't forget to restart Steam on HOST PC once the encoder is disabled/enabled. I expect that you need to have GeForce Experience installed in order to enable NVFBC.
